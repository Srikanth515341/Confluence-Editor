# Collab Editor

A real-time collaborative document editor whose entire value proposition is a
**provable correctness guarantee**: no user's edit is ever silently lost, and
every replica of a document converges to an identical final state — with no
locking, no last-write-wins, and no user-visible merge-conflict prompt.

Convergence is not asserted; it is verified continuously by a randomized
fuzz harness against **OBSEQ**, the sequence CRDT engine this project builds
from scratch (see `packages/engine`), and independently re-verified in
production by a log-replay integrity audit.

## Status

🚧 **Phase 8 — WebSocket gateway and Document Coordinator (in-memory).**
`packages/server` now runs an Express + WebSocket server: the gateway
accepts connections at `/v1/rt` (subprotocol `obseq.v1`, binary frames
only — a text frame closes with code 1003), binds each socket to one
document, and routes every inbound operation through a per-document
`DocumentCoordinator` running the same OBSEQ engine as clients (replica
id 0, reserved for the server). Operations are decoded, applied,
re-stamped with a server-assigned sequence number, and broadcast to
every other connected peer — proved with real `ws` client connections
(no browser, no mocks) exchanging operations and converging. Each
connection maintains three fully separate physical send queues — OPS,
CONTROL, PRESENCE — drained in strict priority order, never a single
FIFO with a priority field. Persistence, acks, auth, presence, and the
real connection handshake are still not built (Phases 9, 15-17, 26-29,
31) — state is in-memory only and lost on restart, which is correct for
this phase.

Progress is tracked phase-by-phase in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md).

## Monorepo layout

```
packages/engine      OBSEQ convergence engine — pure, no I/O, no DOM
packages/protocol    binary wire codec + message types (shared client/server)
packages/server      Express + WebSocket gateway + coordinator + persistence
packages/client      React app + editor binding (DomWriter, cursors, presence)
packages/testkit     fuzz / mutation / network-fault / load harnesses
```

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in real values before running the server
```

## Running checks

```bash
pnpm lint          # ESLint, including the engine-purity rule
pnpm format:check  # Prettier
pnpm typecheck      # tsc --noEmit across every package
pnpm check:purity   # independent grep-based engine-purity check (belt & suspenders)
pnpm test           # Vitest across every package (convergence suite excluded — see below)
```

### The convergence suite

```bash
pnpm test:convergence
```

This is the suite the entire product's correctness claim rests on — see
the Test Plan (§2) for what "converged" means and how it is checked. It
runs six required randomized-interleaving configurations (Test Plan §2.2)
at 10,000 seeds each, and is deliberately kept **separate** from the
ordinary `pnpm test` run (it has its own vitest config). It **passes**:
60,000 total trials across C1–C6, zero divergences, zero stranded
(permanently-pending) operations — with all ten Engine Spec §5 invariants
(I0–I9) actively re-checked after every mutating call throughout every
trial (Test Plan §2.6), not just the pass/fail convergence outcome.

### The property-based suite

```bash
pnpm test:properties
```

Five fast-check properties tied directly to the convergence argument
(Test Plan §2.5), each run at 10,000 generated cases: commutativity of
concurrent operation pairs, idempotence of re-delivery (checked on full
structural state, not just rendered text), order independence across two
different causally-valid linearizations of the same operation set, the
partial-knowledge subsequence guarantee, and clock-skew invariance — plus
an independent source-grep confirming the engine never reads a wall
clock.

### The adversarial suite

```bash
pnpm test:adversarial
```

22 hand-constructed cases (Test Plan §2.4) that randomized fuzzing isn't
aimed at finding on its own — three-way backward-typing runs, a
combining mark racing an ordinary character for the same anchor, an
insert whose originRight arrives before its originLeft, and more. Fast
and deterministic, so unlike the two suites above it also runs as part
of the default `pnpm test`.

### The mutation matrix

```bash
pnpm test:mutation
```

Ten mutants (Test Plan §2.8), each string-patched into an isolated,
freshly-transpiled copy of the engine source — never the real files —
then run against every suite. Proof the suites would actually catch a
broken engine: 9 of 10 mutants are killed, several only after surviving
pure convergence fuzzing and being caught by a hand-picked targeted
check instead. The tenth, `M3_no_case_c`, is the subject of a dedicated
directed search (MUT-KILL-01) run to 10^6 trials — see
[`docs/mutation-matrix.md`](./docs/mutation-matrix.md) for the current
results. Excluded from the default `pnpm test`; the nightly workflow
runs this at full scale on a schedule.
